# DivBox
Frontend built with Bootstrap and JQuery for the DivBox dApp.

DivBox is a dApp that allows users to grow their ETH holdings in two ways:

1. People can buy shares using ETH and sell those shares later with for a profit.
2. Whenever someone buys or sell shares, a transaction fee is taken and distributed as dividends among all shareholders.

ETH used to buy shares is automatically put to earn interest through Compound.Finance (https://compound.finance/). That means that, as long as people have shares in DivBox, these shares will always go up in value since they'll be automatically collecting interest (in ETH) generated by the
Compound protocol.
